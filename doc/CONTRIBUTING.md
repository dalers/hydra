# Contributing

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Please note our code of conduct governing interactions with the project.

Before submitting a pull request, please first discuss your desired change, including
why you believe a change is needed (or what is the problem that needs to be solved)
by one of the following:

* create a discussion topic (for general discussion)
* create an issue (for specific discussion)
* email the repository owner (for preliminary discussion)

It is often helpful to discuss your desired change even before starting to write
code because a similar change may already be in development, or there may be a superior solution
others more familiar with the source can offer.
